# s8


we separated the ResNet code files and saved in google drive as resnetmodel, and uploaded to github

we used dataloader, datatransform, modelstats and model trainer from google drive library created for S7 assignment.

we changed the code to increase the accuracy by adding softmax

We changed the code to replace FC layer to point wise convolution layer

we got 85% accuracy at 8th EPOCH and 90% accuracy at 13th EPOCH
